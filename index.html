            </section>
            <section>
                <p>We have become so dependent on white goods and smart gadgets, especially now when some of them can talk and give advice. Once they are set up, they won’t move and we can enjoy those obedient pets when we want. Yet, <b>moving electronic devices can cause awful headaches</b>. Let’s suppose you are relocating from Passaic to New York. Although you’ve hired one of the local <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/new-jersey-movers/passaic/"> Passaic movers</a>, still it’s you who knows the best about your electronics. Don’t be lazy. Pack them by yourself according to these tips and tricks.</p>
                <p><b>Create a plan for moving electronic devices</b></p>
                <p>As you know, relocation does not refer only to the moving day but also the days of arranging and packing everything. You should plan the whole process in advance paying attention to as many details as possible. A considerable part of that plan includes moving electronic devices, which are not something you can just put in an old box and throw into the truck. </p>
                <p>In case you really don’t know how to organize everything alone, or you don’t have so much time, consider hiring one of the numerous <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/"> NYC movers and packers</a> to assist you. They have <b>lots of professionals</b> who will gladly help to pack electronic devices and move them safely.</p>
                <p>Unplug carefully</p>

                <p>Our smart electronic friends are clever as long as we treat them in accordance with the rules. Before disconnecting them from the network and turning them off, you should check if <a href="https://www.wikihow.com/Back-Up-Data"> the back-up</a> has been done automatically. If not, do the back-up manually just in case. You don’t want to risk losing all your saved photos, TV shows, reminders, passwords, etc. when you finish moving electronics. </p>
                <p>No matter whether it is a smart device or an ordinary kitchen appliance, read the manuals thoroughly. Most of them come with instructions on how to disconnect, unplug, or disassemble, if necessary, in the right way. </p>
                <p>Remove what you have put inside</p>
                <p>While moving electronics, you may experience difficult traveling circumstances, possible changes in temperature, or storage conditions. For that reason, it is recommended that you should <i>remove all the stuff you have put inside your devices</i>. So, remove batteries from remotes, clocks, etc. Eject all tapes, CDs, DVDs, and similar things.</p>
                <p>What is particularly important is to empty the cartridge, fridge, freezer, oven, dishwasher, washing machine, etc. Additionally, <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/better/health/how-clean-almost-every-appliance-your-home-ncna883106"> clean the appliances</a> before wrapping and packing. Especially if they are going to stay in storage for a longer period. You don’t want your cartridge to spill the color everywhere or your fridge to smell bad.</p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/refrigerator-37099_1280-300x254.png"></div>
                <h4>Clean and empty your fridge to prepare it for the moving day.</h4>
                <p>Use the original boxes to pack electronic devices</p>
                <p>If you are lucky enough to <b>find the original packing boxes</b> and materials of your devices, then use them for repacking. Moving electronics in their original containers is beneficial because you don’t have to bother looking for new boxes with perfectly fitting sizes.</p>
                <p>In case you haven’t kept those boxes, you will have to put a lot of effort into finding some good ones. You may need the following <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/the-ultimate-list-of-moving-supplies/"> stuff for moving</a>:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>cardboard boxes or of a different material if necessary</li>
                    <li>various bags, especially the sealable ones</li>
                    <li>loads of bubble wrap, newsprint, styrofoam, packing blankets</li>
                    <li>strong or PVC tape so that the boxes won’t open when moving electronic devices</li>
                    <li>markers and sticky notes</li>
                    <li>scissors</li>

                    <h4>Moving electronic devices, such as TVs, needs extra caution and specific packaging.</h4>

                </section>
                <p>A thing of utmost importance is not to use any kind of paper or material to cover devices with screens. <i>Newspapers may live print marks, just like bubble wrap can leave dirty spots, and you might find your screen damaged</i>. That is why the original packaging is extremely useful together with packing blankets.</p>
                <p>Label your moving electronics</p>
                <p>Use some markers to <b>label every box and bag when you pack electronic devices</b>. If the package requires special care and extra caution, mark it in a visible way. For instance, you can write: “Handle with care” or “Fragile”. Apart from those labels, you can also make notes on which side goes up and which one goes down by writing the very words or drawing arrows to show the position.</p>
                <p>Organize the cables, wires, and other equipment, such as spare parts, screws, and plugs,  in a logical manner. <i>Tie the things that go together and don’t separate them</i>. Put different cables in different bags or boxes. Use colors to mark cables depending on which input they are for. Doing so will enable you to re-assemble and set up your moving electronics with ease. </p>
                <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;"><img style="height: 200px; width: 30%;" src="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/picspree-421224-300x225.jpg"></div>
                <h4>Separate cables and organize them in a logical way.</h4>
                <p>Any kind of labeling will help for sure. Thus you won’t end up with a bunch of cables and tiny parts not knowing how to separate them and what they are all for.</p>

                <p>If you really want to be a step forward, here is some additional advice on how to relocate electronics in a responsible and efficient manner.</p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Don’t pack electronic devices together with other things, especially not liquids or chemicals, sharp objects, and other electronics.</li>
                    <li>Don’t save money on bubble wrap, packing blankets, and other items for protection.</li>
                    <li>Put appropriate <b>protection on sensitive parts</b>, such as fans and screens, in order to eliminate dust and temperature influence.</li>
                    <li>If you are renting storage, consider studying the conditions in detail, as cold, heat, and humidity can severely damage electronics.</li>
                    <li>You might wish to <a href="https://dynamicmoversnyc.com/the-importance-of-insurance-and-licensing-when-hiring-movers/"> pay for some insurance</a> when moving electronics.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>What to do when you finish moving electronics</p>
                <p>To begin with, check that <i>all boxes and bags have been transferred</i> to the new place. Do it simply by counting the number of them. If something is missing, check the truck again or call your mover so that they can help you solve the problem. </p>
                <p>Afterward, shuffle the inventory into the right rooms. Start unpacking with care since the electronic devices are still fragile and may be damaged. <b>Use the manuals once again</b>, as before moving electronic devices, now to re-assemble and set up everything right.</p>
